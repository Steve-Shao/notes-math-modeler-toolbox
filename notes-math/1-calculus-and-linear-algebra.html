            For complete beginners, the goal is to first get familar with definitions and concepts. 
            Courses like
            <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1">Calculus 1</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-2">2</a> and
            <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra">Linear Algebra</a> on
            <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> 
            is a great point to start with. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The next step is then to obtain a deeper understanding towards the concepts and techniques. 
            Personally, I really like the video series
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Essence of Calculus</a> and
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra</a>. I particularly enjoy the visualizations in these videos which give you very clear and intuitive explanations to complicated ideas.

            If you want to learn more about the theorems that build the fundation of calculus and linear algebra, you may need to take a more serious approach. Many top universitys provide open courses on these topics. 
            For example, <a href="https://web.mit.edu">MIT</a> has put their 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbIQW0gkgxo&list=PLE2215608E2574180">Calculus</a> and
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UJ4CFRGd-U&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8">Linear Algebra</a> course online for free. You do not need to be a student there to take these great courses. 
          </li>
          <li>
            After all these, you may still want to keep some textbooks at hand as you may constantly need to look up things. Alternatively, since calculus and linear algebra are so fundamental, you can get almost any question answered with the help of search engines and online communities like 
            <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com">StackExchange</a>. 
          </li>
          <li>Other useful tools: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You should know 
              <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com">WolframAlpha</a>. 
              It is just wonderful. 
            </li>
            <li>
              There are great 
              <a href="https://www.derivative-calculator.net">Derivative Calculators</a> and
              <a href="https://www.integral-calculator.com">Integral Calculators</a> online. 
              No matter what level you are currently at, they are likely to be helpful.
